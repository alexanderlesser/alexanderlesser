  in 2017 I didn’t have much expectation about the life as a software developer. But I am so 
  grateful for the university and how they let us test different things to find out what you enjoy
   doing as a software developer. As I have always had an interest in design whether it be an 
   application or a photo, I found frontend-development to be one of my strong sides.`,
